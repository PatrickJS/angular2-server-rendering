# angular2-example-isomorphic
WIP: isomorphic angular2

Until I get the `Compiler` working I have the server point to the `app.js` with a mini template engine. Please switch back to `app_server.js` in `./index.js` to use the angular2 version where I'm having problems creating the `Compiler`


## Build

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
$ nodemon
```


## Todo:
* get Compiler working
* get new router working
* structure app to manage the same state
* have the app work without javascript
